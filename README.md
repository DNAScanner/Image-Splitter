# Image Splitter by DNA
Hello,
this is a project I made just for fun, which allows you to automatically split an image (`input.png`) into smaller portions, especially practical for discord emotes. Written in TypeScript with [Deno](https://deno.land/)

## How to use
- Put your input image in the project directory and name it `input.png`
- Provide required parameters in the `prefix` and `split`-files
- Run the script with `deno run -A main.ts`
- The output files will be placed into `./output/`
- A premade copy-paste text for using these emotes will be put in `bio.txt`
